ðŸ§© **Packages Used**

**get_it** â€“ Used for dependency injection, making it easy to manage and access app-wide services and objects without tight coupling.

**retrofit + dio** â€“ Used together for network communication.

**Dio** handles HTTP requests, responses, and interceptors.

**Retrofit** provides a type-safe, declarative API interface on top of Dio for cleaner networking code.

**flutter_bloc** â€“ Used for state management, implementing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to separate business logic from presentation for better scalability and testability.

**go_router** â€“ Used for navigation and routing, providing a declarative and URL-based approach to handle app navigation with deep linking support.

**shared_preferences** â€“ Used for local data storage, allowing the app to save small pieces of persistent data such as user preferences, tokens, or settings.

**skeletonizer** â€“ Used to display skeleton loading placeholders, enhancing user experience during data loading states.

**google_fonts** â€“ Used to customize typography by easily applying Google Fonts throughout the app for consistent and visually appealing text styles.
